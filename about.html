      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
      I'm an aspiring computer scientist from Calgary, Alberta.
      </p>

      <p>
      Currently I'm a undergraduate student at 
      the University of British Columbia, 
      pursuing a combined degree in Computer Science and Statistics. 

      Recently I've really been interested in probability and statistics,
      especially stochastic processes and inference theory
      (MATH 419 and STAT 461 in particular).
      </p>

      <p>
      I've interned as a software engineer at AWS (twice), Tesla, and VIPRE Security.
      You can find out more about my experiences on my resume down below.
      </p>

      <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy lifting weights.
      I'm currently training for 2024 Canadian Powerlifting Nationals.
      Check out some of my lifts below!
