  Bittersweet meet performance.
  I hit a nice milestone of a 3x bodyweight squat,
  but had some more left in the tank
  and should have pushed it more.
  Also almost hit a 4x bodyweight deadlift,
  but I couldn't hold on to it at the top.
  Working on making sure my grip is more consistent.

  Aside from my own performance,
  I had an amazing time.
  Watching high level lifters
  in person is really inspiring
  and tells you that the sky is the limit
  when it comes to progress.
