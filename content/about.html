  Currently I'm a undergraduate student at 
  the University of British Columbia
  studying Computer Science and Statistics. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Recently I've been very interested in probability and statistics,
  especially stochastic processes and inference theory
  (MATH 419 and STAT 461 if you go to UBC).

  <p>
  I've interned as a software engineer at AWS (twice), Tesla, and VIPRE Security.
  You can find out more about my experiences on my resume below.

  <p>
  I have aspirations to contribute to research in statistics/ML theory.
  Might go to grad school in the future, we'll see.

  Outside of work and school, I enjoy lifting weights.
  I'm currently training for 2024 Canadian Powerlifting Nationals.
