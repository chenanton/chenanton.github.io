  Currently I'm a undergrad at the University of British Columbia
  studying Computer Science and Statistics.

  My interests lie in statistics and machine learning.
  I have strong interests in foundation models,
  reasoning in LLMs, and general logic/commonsense reasoning in ML.
  To me these are areas which have immense potential for improvement,
  and will have huge impact on our world if improved.
  It's the obvious next step in ML.
  There's some papers on my website I've linked that I think are good.
  I've also been curious about Bayesian statistics.
  Building robust models that focus on modelling uncertainty just 
  seems the rational thing to do.

  I've spent a good chunk of my undergrad learning software development.
  My internships include Amazon Web Services (twice) and Tesla.
  I'll be returning to AWS full-time (for a third time) once I graduate.
  Our team works on the 
  <a target="_blank"  
    href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/">
    AWS Auto Scaling</a>
  service.
  It uses predictive and reactive strategies to 
  automatically scale compute capacity for our customer's services.
  It powers many other popular AWS services, including Lambda, DynamoDB, EC2, etc.
  The coolest thing to me are the
  <a target="_blank"  
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-predictive-scaling.html">
   predictive strategies</a> used for forecasting.

  Outside of my career I enjoy lifting weights.
  I'm currently training for 2024 Canadian Powerlifting Nationals.
  My lifetime goal is to compete for Team Canada
  at IPF Worlds. 
  Working hard (and eating hard) to make that happen.
  Check out some of my lifts below!
