  Currently I'm a undergrad at the University of British Columbia
  studying Computer Science and Statistics. 
  </p>

  <p>
  My interests lie in statistics and machine learning.
  I have very strong interests in foundation models,
  reasoning in LLMs, and general logic/commonsense reasoning in ML.
  To me these are areas which have immense potential for improvement,
  and will have huge impact on our world if improved.
  There's some papers on my website I've linked that I think are really good.
  I've also been especially curious about Bayesian statistics.
  Building robust models that focus on modelling uncertainty just 
  seems the rational thing to do.

  <p>
  I've spent a good chunk of my undergrad learning software development.
  I've interned as a software engineer at AWS (twice), Tesla, and VIPRE Security.
  I'll be returning to AWS full-time once I graduate.
  You can find out more about my experiences on my resume below.

  Outside of my career, I enjoy lifting weights.
  I'm currently training for 2024 Canadian Powerlifting Nationals.
