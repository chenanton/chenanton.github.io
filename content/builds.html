Some non-career-related projects I've worked on, and some in-progress ones.

  ThinkPad X61
  <ul>
    <li>Intel Core 2 Duo T7500 (midrange).</li>
    <li>8GB DDR2 RAM, upgraded from 2GB.</li>
    <li>1400x1050 LED screen upgrade. It came with a terrible low-res TN panel.</li>
    <li>Intel 6E AX210 wifi card upgrade.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  This is my main laptop for work as a student.
  Despite being released in 2006,
  it holds up surprisingly well.
  My typical workflow mostly consists of 
  text editing (e.g. coding, typesetting),
  reading (pdfs),
  browsing the web,
  and it's more than capable enough for light tasks such as these.
  It gets a battery life of around 5 hours of light usage,
  which is more than enough for attending lectures
  or for studying at the library.
  It's the last thinkpad to be designed by IBM
  (around when Lenovo acquired the brand),
  and is the best laptop of all time IMO.
  The keyboard beats any other laptop keyboard out there,
  and no trackpad is a plus too.

  <h3>2. Mechanical Keyboard</h3>

  Niu Mini
  <ul>
    <li>40% ortholinear layout.</li>
    <li>NovelKey Cream switches.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Lubed with Krytox 205g0.</li>
      <li>No films (creams are already so tight LOL).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>AliExpress blank XDA profile keycaps.</li>
    <li> <a href="https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/">Programmer Dvorak</a> layout with 
      <a href="https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods">home row mods</a>, 
      flashed via QMK.
    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>
  This is the first mechanical keyboard I built,
  sometime during second year.
  I wanted something small,
  with a clean and simple design.
  It looks a little weird, but the ortholinear layout doesn't take too long to get used to
  and actually feels a bit better than a regular layout.
  You don't have to slant your hands if that makes sense.
  The blank keycaps are nice too,
  since it forces you to type without looking at your keyboard
  (and I think it looks better).
  But the main thing that makes this keyboard so cool
  is it's size.
  Since it's so small, you don't have to move your hands
  at all.
  Any key is within reach.
  It makes typing much more comfortable once you learn the layout.
  </p>

  <p>
  As a student I don't use it too much,
  since I'm out of the house most of the time.
  Great for WFH though.

  <h3> 3. Software </h3>
  <div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
      <img src="assets/builds/software/desktop.png">
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="assets/builds/software/typesetting.png">
    </div>
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>Operating system: Gentoo Linux.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Manually compiled kernel with tuned kernel flags.</li>
      <li>O3 link time optimization on applicable packages.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Full Wayland, dwl (<a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> clone)
    </li>
    <li>Workflow: vim, tmux, qutebrowser, zathura.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Neovim plugins: treesitter, vimtex, ultisnips, orgmode.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <p>
  My goal with this is to create as bare-bones 
  of a software setup as possible without sacrificing usability.
  Gentoo took about 2 days to compile on the X61,
  but we got it done.
  It runs so fast LMAO.
  Makes this 15-year old thinkpad feel like a modern laptop.
  Orgmode is genius, and is making me consider learning Emacs.
  Vim is very much good enough for now though.
  Haven't felt the need to use an IDE,
  and don't plan on starting anytime soon.
  I only recently switched to wayland,
  and it was tough leaving all the suckless programs
  (dwm, st).
  Clones exist and they do a pretty good job from what I can tell.

<h3>
  4. Future Projects
</h3>

<p>
You'll find that a lot of these projects
share a common theme of minimalism while maintaining utility.
I'm looking to start a few other projects in a similar vain.
</p>

<p>
The first one I'm thinking of is a used car.
Very surprised I haven't started this yet.
I guess it's because Vancouver's transit system is so good lol.
I'm not very educated when it comes to cars,
so lmk if you have any recommendations.
I'm thinking of a 7th gen Honda Civic,
but I'm still in the process of learning the culture
and what cars are out there.
</p>

<p>
Another one that's a WIP is building a wardobe.
I'm definitely not the most fashionable person, but I'm slowly learning.
I know I fw vintage clothing,
but still need to explore this more.
For now, my wardrobe are random pieces
from garage sales,
and Uniqlo :).
</p>

<p>
Finally, I might need to build a PC.
I built one when I was 15,
but that one was for gaming.
This one is gonna be more for work stuff
(e.g. training models).
</p>
