  <p>
    We propose a Bayesian approach to premise
    generation by constructing a probability model on 
    entailment trees, iterative sampling an entailment tree bottom-up
    from initial premises i.e. leaf nodes. We expand on previous 
    work in the area by exploring premise retrieval premise generation
    through a Bayesian lens, defining priors and likelihoods on
    retrieved and generated premises. We implement the model
    with approximate variational methods in Pyro, a PPL for Python.
