  <h2>Rubik's Cube Solver Neural Network</h2>

  <p>
    Got bored during COVID,
    so I learned some ML
    from Coursera's
    Deep Learning Specialization
    and made this.

    Can we harness the power of machine learning to solve a Rubik's Cube? 
    Turns out we can! This project implements a deep neural network 
    to learn how to solve any scrambled Rubik's Cube,
    along with all the infrastructure to generate a dataset to learn from.
