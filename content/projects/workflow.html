  My goal with this is to create as bare-bones 
  of a software setup as possible without sacrificing usability.
  Gentoo took about 2 days to compile on the X61,
  but we got it done.
  It runs so fast LMAO.
  Makes this 18-year old thinkpad feel like a modern laptop.
  Orgmode is genius, and is making me consider learning Emacs.
  Vim is very much good enough for now though.
  Haven't felt the need to use an IDE,
  and don't plan on starting anytime soon.
  I only recently switched to wayland,
  and it was tough leaving all the suckless programs
  (dwm, st).
  Clones exist and they do a pretty good job from what I can tell.
