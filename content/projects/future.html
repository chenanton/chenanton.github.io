<h3>
  Future Projects
</h3>

<p>
You'll find that a lot of these projects
share a common theme of minimalism while maintaining utility.
I'm looking to start a few other projects in a similar vain.

<p>
The first one I'm thinking of is a used car.
Very surprised I haven't started this yet.
I guess it's because Vancouver's transit system is so good lol.
I'm not very educated when it comes to cars,
so lmk if you have any recommendations.
I'm thinking of a 7th gen Honda Civic,
but I'm still in the process of learning the culture
and what cars are out there.

Another one that's a WIP is building a wardobe.
I'm definitely not the most fashionable person, but I'm slowly learning.
I know I fw vintage clothing,
but still need to explore this more.
For now, my wardrobe are random pieces
from garage sales,
and Uniqlo :).
</p>

<p>
Finally, I might need to build a PC.
I built one when I was 15,
but that one was for gaming.
This one is gonna be more for work stuff
(e.g. training models).
