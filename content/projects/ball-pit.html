    It's a simple, cross-platform two-dimensional physics simulation
    written in Java.
    I thought that it would be a challenge to translate concepts 
    I learned from other classes into code.
    Not only did this help me gain a deeper understanding of these concepts,
    but also allowed me to practice fundamental programming patterns.
