    In this project we demonstrate the application of 
    Wilcoxonâ€™s signed-rank test for paired samples 
    on quality score samples for pairwise comparison 
    of dimensionality reduction algorithms. 
    We outline the task of dimensionality reduction (DR), 
    various DR algorithms, quality measures, 
    and the task of DR algorithm comparison. 
    We demonstrate how to use the original data
    to generate paired distributions
    of quality score data,
    appropriate for analysis
    via the signed-rank test.
    Finally, we implement and analyze the methodology 
    on the real-world task of identifying performant document embeddings for topic classification
    by analyzing the 20newsgroups data set of approximately 20000 newsgroups posts.
