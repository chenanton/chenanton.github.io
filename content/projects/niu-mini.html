  <h3>NIU Mini</h3>

  <p>
    I built a mechanical keyboard.

  <ul>
    <li>40% ortholinear layout.</li>
    <li>NovelKey Cream switches.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Lubed with Krytox 205g0.</li>
      <li>No films (creams are already so tight LOL).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>AliExpress blank XDA profile keycaps.</li>
    <li> <a href="https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/">Programmer Dvorak</a> layout with 
      <a href="https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods">home row mods</a>, 
      flashed via QMK.
    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>
  I wanted something small,
  with a clean and simple design.
  It looks a little weird, but the ortholinear layout doesn't take too long to get used to
  and actually feels a bit better than a regular layout.
  You don't have to slant your hands if that makes sense.
  The blank keycaps are nice too,
  since it forces you to type without looking at your keyboard
  (and I think it looks better).
  But the main thing that makes this keyboard so cool
  is it's size.
  Since it's so small, you don't have to move your hands
  at all.
  Any key is within reach.
  It makes typing much more comfortable once you learn the layout.

  As a student I don't use it too much,
  since I'm out of the house most of the time.
  Great for WFH though.
