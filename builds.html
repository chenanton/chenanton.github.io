  <h2>Builds</h2>

  Some non-career-related projects I've worked on.

    <h3>1. Laptop</h3>

    ThinkPad X61
    <ul>
      <li>Intel Core 2 Duo T7500 (midrange).</li>
      <li>8GB DDR2 RAM, upgraded from 2GB.</li>
      <li>1400x1050 LED screen upgrade. It came with a terrible low-res TN panel.</li>
      <li>Intel 6E AX210 wifi card upgrade.</li>
    </ul>

    This is my main laptop for work as a student.
    Despite being released in 2006,
    it holds up surprisingly well.
    My typical workflow mostly consists of 
    text editing (e.g. coding, typesetting),
    reading (pdfs),
    browsing the web,
    and it's more than capable enough for light tasks such as these.
    It gets a battery life of around 5 hours of light usage,
    which is more than enough for attending lectures
    or for studying at the library.
    It's the last thinkpad to be designed by IBM
    (around when Lenovo acquired the brand),
    and is the best laptop of all time IMO.
    The keyboard beats any other laptop keyboard out there,
    and no trackpad is a plus too.

        flashed via QMK.

    This is the first mechanical keyboard I built,
    sometime during second year.
    I wanted something small,
    with a clean and simple design.
    It looks a little weird, but the ortholinear layout doesn't take too long to get used to
    and actually feels a bit better than a regular layout.
    You don't have to slant your hands if that makes sense.
    The blank keycaps are nice too,
    since it forces you to type without looking at your keyboard
    (and I think it looks better).
    But the main thing that makes this keyboard so cool
    is it's size.
    Since it's so small, you don't have to move your hands
    at all.
    Any key is within reach.
    It makes typing much more comfortable once you learn the layout.

    As a student I don't use it too much,
    since I'm out of the house most of the time.
