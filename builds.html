      <h2>Builds</h2>

      Some non-career-related projects I've worked on.

      <h3>Thinkpad X61</h3>

      <p>
      This is my main laptop for work as a student.
      Despite being released in 2006,
      it holds up surprisingly well.
      My typical workflow mostly consists of 
      text editing (e.g. coding, typesetting),
      reading (pdfs),
      browsingthe web,
      and it's more than capable enough for light tasks such as these.
      It gets a battery life of around 5 hours of light usage,
      which is more than enough for attending lectures
      or for studying at the library.
      It's the last thinkpad to be designed by IBM
      (around when Lenovo acquired the brand),
      and is the best looking laptop of all time IMO.
