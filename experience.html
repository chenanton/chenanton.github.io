					<p>
						During my time at VIPRE, 
						I worked on email security with the back-end team. 
						I was responsible for overhauling the back-end testing process, 
						where I designed and developed a test automation framework in Python 
						to replace manual testing. 
						This framework is to fully automate REST API endpoint 
						and SMTP mail server testing for verification 
						on email processing services.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also designed and ran test suites with Pythonâ€™s Robot Framework
						and Jira Xray to verify fixes for high-priority bugs affecting critical 
						production AWS services and MySQL databases, 
						processing over 1.2 billion emails monthly from 50 000 business customers.
